1. d4 {Topalov and Aronian met last time in the second round of Wijk aan Zee
tournament (January 2008). In that game Topalov achieved advantage with Black,
but completely misplayed the position and lost. In the end Aronian shared
first place, while Topalov made a minus score, finishing on the 9th place...}
Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3 {This system was prepared by Kasparov and very
successfully implemented in his second match versus Karpov (Moscow 1985),
which was a surprise at that time, since 4.Nf3 has been considered a harmless
move until then. In the past decades the theory of 4.Nf3 developed a lot.
Topalov and Aronian have a vaste experience with it with both colours.} c5 5.
g3 {The arising positions are often a sort of mixture between Nimzo, Catalan
and English Opening.} cxd4 6. Nxd4 Ne4 7. Qd3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 Nc5 9. Qf3 d6 10.
Bg2 {A solid variation for Black, who has a better pawn structure as the
compensation for opponent's bishop pair. White's task is to exert pressure on
Black's queenside and on the d-file, trying to open the position.} e5 (10...
Nbd7 {was met in practice of both Topalov and Aronian. They must have come to
the conclusion that White's chances are preferable after that.}) 11. Qe3 {
An important novelty in the well-known position. White's idea is to retreat
the knight to b3 with greater effect.} (11. Nb3 Nba6 12. Ba3 Qc7 13. Rd1 Be6

13. Nxc5 dxc5 (13... Qxc5 14. Qxc5 dxc5 15. Be3 {is unpleasant for Black.}) 14.
O-O Nd7 15. f4 {The right position for Topalov: White has the initiative and
enough resources to exert pressure on opponent. Considering that in opposite
to Aronian the Bulgarian must have analyzed the position at home, it becomes
clear that Levon's task was exceptionally difficult.} exf4 {During the next
few moves the position will become from good to almost winning for White, so
around here Black should look for improvements.} 16. Rxf4 a5 {Very creative:
the rook will enter the game via a6. Unfortunately for Aronian, this does not
solve Black's problems.} 17. Qe7 Qe5 18. Qxe5 Nxe5 19. Be3 Nd7 20. Re4 {
The rook goes to e7 and it becomes clear that White's advantage should be
decisive.} Ra6 21. Rb1 Rg6 22. Re7 b6 23. Bf4 {A complete domination of white
pieces. On top of all Aronian was already experiencing problems with the time
on the clock, so the rest was a technical matter for the ex-World Champion.} h5

1. e4 c5 {Anand usually replies 1.e4 with either 1...e5 or 1...c5. In the last
decade he lost with 1...e5 extremely rare and won almost every fourth game (in
average, naturally). Sicilian is a much riskier choice for the World Champion:
he lost considerably more games after 1...c5 than after 1...e5. Nevertheless
his winning quota with Sicilian is also much higher. Considering Anand's large
plus score against Shirov, the choice of Sicilian was expectable - the World
Champion intended to play for a win right from his very first game in Morelia!}
2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {Shirov has ed many games
with 6.Be3 against Najdorf, but he switched to 6.Bg5 lately, so Anand was
certanly well prepared to meet it.} e6 7. f4 Nbd7 {

8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O b5 10. Bd3 {Shirov remains true to his style. He prefers
to go for complicated battle rather than make short draws, which is very
appealing to spectators. The drawback of this style is that sometimes his
opponents are trying to take advantage of Shirov's fighting mood.} (10. e5 {
The chess theory is so much developed, that even in the sharpest variations
there are often forced draws. Take a look at the following game:} Bb7 11. Qh3

# Now draw y repetition: checks on d5 and a5. The entire variation is more or
less forced: after 10.e5 Black should objectively go for it and repeat moves
in the end. The diagram position is from the game Nisipeanu,L (2584)-Shirov,A
(2734), Las Vegas 1999, where the Romanian Grandmaster quite unexpectedly
forced such a draw with the white pieces in the first game of their mini-match.
Normally this should have meant a psychological victory for Shirov, who made
an easy draw with black, but on the other hand it provoked him to play the
second game even more aggressive than usual. Nisipeanu won it with Black,
cleverly using Shirov's hyper-aggressive play...}) 10... Bb7 11. Rhe1 Qb6 (

1. e4 {How often does Anand lose with the white pieces? Surely not too often,
for instance in 2007 he didn't lose a single game (talking about classical
chess). On the other hand when the Indian does lose, he can do it in such a
painful way, that it is not even clear what went wrong. Was it a bad opening
choice, a poor play in general, a blunder in one move, or just a sleepless
night before? Considering Anand's lack of resistance in problematic positions
of these games, the answer is: EVERYTHING went wrong. On top of all, the
opponent's play is impeccable. But..."every cloud has a silver lining" - maybe
this is why the World Champion loses rarer than other players: the full
portion of all bad factors is concentrated in a single game, while for most
other players it is dispersed in different games?} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4.

1. e4 {Topalov and Anand are marching through in Morelia. The Bulgarian is
leading with 2,5 points out of three (3000+ Elo performance!), the world
champion has half a point less. Together they scored four wins so far. No one
else has a plus score after the first three rounds. Another impressive victory
for the ex-world champion. Just like in the first round win against Aronian,
Topalov used opponent's few inaccuracies in the opening to take over the
initiative, after which at no point of the game there were any doubts left
about the final result.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {

build pressure after opening the files on the queenside.} a4 (16... O-O {

finishes them in force. Unfortunately, this highly intriguing, but at the same
time risky "strategy" can't last forever, as the Corus tournament showed
recently. It is great to see that in Morelia Topalov found a good form right
from the start. After the World Championship in 2005 Topalov never started a
tournament so strongly again. However, the temptation to make a parallel with
the San Luis tournament will have to wait. In Argentina scoring 2,5 points out
of three was just a prelude for the future world champion, who in the next
rounds produced four consecutive wins. So let's wait a little bit to see if in
Morelia Topalov will continue in the same impressive fashion.} 1-0

right direction for White to fight for advantage and that's exactly what
Kasparov did in the 2000 World Championship match against Kramnik. But again
and again Gary was failing to set problems to Kramnik. Later Kasparov said
that during the match he was advised to play 4.d3, but that he simply wouldn't
listen to such advices... Radjabov's decision to avoid the "Berlin endgame" is
wise for pure psychological reasons: Carlsen played three times 3...Nf6 before.
